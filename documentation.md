- **Unified Diff Viewer:** Professional-grade diff interface with line numbers, hunk headers, and syntax-aware highlighting.
- **Stage & Commit:** Seamless GUI workflow for staging files and creating new commits.
- **Push to Remote:** One-click synchronization with your remote server when your local branch is ahead.

### 3. Repository Insights

## 🛡 Security & Performance

### Security Boundaries
- **Anti-Injection:** All Git commands are executed using safe argument arrays, protecting against shell injection.
- **Electron Hardening:** Strict `contextIsolation` and `webSecurity` settings. External navigation is disabled by default.
- **Protocol Validation:** External links are validated against a strict protocol whitelist (HTTPS only).

### Performance Architecture
- **Web Worker Layout:** Graph layout calculations are performed off-thread to ensure zero-stutter navigation.
- **Memory Safety:** A 10MB safety buffer is applied to all Git output streams to prevent memory exhaustion on massive diffs.
- **List Virtualization:** Uses `react-window` to ensure only visible rows are rendered in the DOM, maintaining 60FPS scrolling.
